# Researching rental apartment market in Tel Aviv

## Understanding the problem <br/>

The purpose of the analyses - Analyze the rental market in Tel Aviv

## Data collection <br/>
As data source I've chosen the rental apartments from 'nadlan' section of website yad2.co.il. Using the code written in Python I scrapped the data from the website and wrote it into Excel file  
I scrapped the main details regarding the apartments, that can be used in analysis. Also, I got the coordinates of every apartment using google map api.
Also, I scrapped Tel Aviv's colleges and universities data and got its coordinates using google map api

## Cleaning and transforming data <br/>
After analyzing the scrapped data I found out that there were apartments with not proper neighborhood(for example neighborhood Tel Aviv Yaffo) name or without address. 
And also there were apartments without rental amount data, that was meaningful for the future analysis
Except separated files from every scrapping I have file with all scrapings and the scrapping date.
